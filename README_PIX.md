# PIX Page Bug Report

## Bug Description

The PIX page has several issues that prevent it from being usable. These include:

*   **Header Problems:** The header for sports other than MLB is not formatted correctly and contains underscores.
*   **Logos Not Appearing:** Logos for sports other than MLB are not appearing on the page.
*   **Live Games in MLB Menu:** The MLB menu is showing live games when it should only show pre-game options.
*   **Menus Not Working:** All menus (other than the MLB menu) do not bring up any games when clicked.
*   **Submit PIX Positioning:** When submitting a PIX, the confirmation/entry box appears in the bottom left of the screen instead of being centered.

## Expected Behavior

The PIX page should:

*   Display a correctly formatted header for all sports.
*   Display logos for all teams in all sports.
*   Only show pre-game options in the MLB menu.
*   Load games for all sports menus.
*   Display the confirmation/entry box in the center of the page.

4.  Check the header for each sport to ensure it is formatted correctly.
5.  Check if the team logos are displayed correctly for each sport.
6.  Click on the MLB menu and verify that only pre-game options are shown.
7.  Click on a bet to open the confirmation modal and verify that it is centered on the page.
