# OLD version
@app.route("/profile/<username>")
def profile(username):
    # For now, it just renders the static page.
    return render_template('profile.html')```

**Delete that entire function** and replace it with this new, much more powerful version:

```python
# NEW version
@app.route("/profile/<username>")
def profile(username):
    # Find the user in the database by their username.
    # If the user doesn't exist, this will automatically show a 404 Not Found page.
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first_or_404()

    # --- This is temporary! ---
    # We don't have a "Picks" table yet, so we can't calculate real stats.
    # For now, we will just send some placeholder data to our template.
    # In the future, we will replace this with real database calculations.
    placeholder_stats = {
        'roi': '0.00',
        'units': '0.00',
        'win_pct': '0.00',
        'z_score': 'N/A',
        'clv': '0.0'
    }

    # Now, render the template and pass the user object and our placeholder stats to it.
    # The HTML can now access `user.username`, `user_stats.roi`, etc.
    return render_template('profile.html', title=user.username, user=user, user_stats=placeholder_stats)
