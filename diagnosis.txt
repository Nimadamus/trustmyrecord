Diagnosis: The root cause of the issues with the PIX page is a combination of missing data and incorrect data handling. The "Menus Not Working" issue is due to the `get_odds` function in `sports_api.py` not returning data for sports other than MLB, and the `mock_data.py` file not having mock data for other sports. The "Logos Not Appearing" issue is because the logo files for sports other than MLB are missing and the `TEAM_TO_FILE` dictionary in `routes.py` only contains MLB teams. The "Live Games in MLB Menu" issue is likely due to a timezone mismatch or an incorrect date format in the `commence_time` field, which can only be confirmed by inspecting the logs.

Next Step: The next step is to test the application with the updated `mock_data.py` to confirm that the PIX page renders correctly for all sports. Then, I will need to get the correct API data for the other sports and populate the logo files and the `TEAM_TO_FILE` dictionary.
